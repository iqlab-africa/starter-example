# VideoBot

Example Robocorp bot that searches for sports videos and sends the results to a backend
The Bot searches videos about football as defined by the world and as defined by the United States. It searches the web using a SERP API and filters the results before sending them to the starter backend where they are saved in a database. The bot is deployed on Robocorp's Control Room (the screenshots represents the experience). The iOS/Android/Web app starts and stops the VideoBot and consumes the search result. Please see the code in the other 2 repos.
