# VideoBot - sports video finder

This is an example project meant to help create standards for IQLab repositories. The code contained herein works as advertised and could be used in a hands-on interaction or training. The robot runs both locally and when deployed to Robocorp's Control Room. The robot can be started and stopped via API and this is demonstrated by the Flutter app that resides in the **starter_app** repoistory
